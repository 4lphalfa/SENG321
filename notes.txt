Not fixing requirements can be expensive

Requirements Engineering is about Expectations Management

Develop skils for
    - analysis and contract negotiation
    - solution seeking in context of customer problem
    - choosing the right requirements technique for particular projects, organizational setting and development process model
    - requirements validation for solution fit

Latent Knowledge:
    Knowledge that is not readily accessable

Tact Knowledge:
    Knowledge that is readily available, but is considered too obvious to mention

Strategic Considerations to Elicitation
    - What info should be gathered
    - From what sources may it be gleamed
    - By what mechanisms or techniques may it be gathered

Requirements Engineering Process:
    - A description of the problem domain
    - A list of problems requiring solution
    - Any client-imposed constraints upon the behavior or structure of the solution system

Sources of info for Problem Domain
    - Clients
    - Clients' "specifications"
    - Pre-existing solutions and their documentation
    - Users of pre-existing systems
    - Potential users of the new system
    - Predecessor or competitor's products
    - Application (problem) domain experts
    - Documents defining the characteristics and behavior of any interfacing system (terminators)
    - Relevant technical standards and legislation

Elicitation Techniques
    - Background reading
    - Brain storming
    - Discourse analysis
    - Document inspection
    - Ethnography
    - Interviewing
    - Joint Application Design
    - Questionnairs
    - Requirements stripping
    - Sitting with Nellie
    - Task observation
    - Use-case and scenairos

Elicitation Plan Considerations
    - What info should be elicited
    - What sources should be used
    - What mechanisms or techniques should be employed

Info to Elicit
    - The basic type of application
    - The identity of the client
    - The main motivation to the client
    - etc...

Social-political considerations that might interfere with elicitation
    - Fear of redundency
    - Fear of down-sizing
    - Promotion
    - A desire to prove themselves right
    - A desire to maintain power through knowledge
    - Empire building


What is Requirements Engineering
    Set of activities to identify purpose in the context of human activities

If the software doesn't respond how we want, it's not high quality
High quality is hard to measure

Software quality as firness for purpose

Where does RE fint in software development?
    Start early, but we now use iterative design, so RE is revisited frequently

RE requires an ongoing understanding of the problem

Design of software intensive systems: type of a wicked problem:
    - No single formulation of the problem
    - Continuous need for exploration
    - No right or wrong solution
    - Unique characteristics
... Identifying the problem is a problem in itself

Hard vs. Soft Systems
    - Soft systems methods 
        suited for wicked problems
        adopt a Human-centered design view

Requirements Engineering Definition
    RE is a set of activities concerned with identifying and ... - Easterbrook, Ch1

A spectrum of software-intensive systems
    The type of system may determine how requirements are elicited, analyzed, and negotiated

Requirements describe problems
    Requirements
        describe the problem statements
        and
        activites to be supported by the system
    Ideal: separate the problem from solutions
    Practice: very difficult to accomplish

Figure 3 (Easterbrook Ch2): Twin peaks model

Application domain vs. Machine domain (Jackson, The meaning of requirements, 1977)

Example - problem and req vs solution statement
    Context: Design a secure means (software, i.e. the machine) to store data
    Example of a requirements (for the machine): prevent access to unauthorized personnel:
    Example of Domain property: only a manager can assign access authority
    Specification for the machine: when the user enters a valid password, the computer will unlock the door (or the system requires a login and password for access")
    
Problem
Specification
Solution

RE processes
    - Elicitation
    - Analysis
    - Specification
    - Validation and verification
    - Negotiation
    - Management

Do not talk about solutions when eliciting info about the client's problem


Interviews

Distinguish between wants, needs, and wishes
    Try to get the needs

Main Elicitation Techniques
    - Background reading / inspection of documents
    - Interviews
    - Questionnaires
    - Observations
    - Group techniques (JAD, focus groups)
    - Contextual design (Combine interviews and observations)
    - Newer methods:
        * StakeSource
        * Data mining

Interviews
    - Most widely used technique in requirements engineering
    - Analysts interview future users of the system individually to find out
        - What the present system does
        - What changes are needed
    - The info gathered during the interviews enables the analysts to design a new system that will eliminate the shortcomings of the current one.

    Advantages
        - Access to individual stakeholders and their opinions
        - Rich collection of info
        - Ability to adapt questions to particualr situations
    
    Disadvantages
        - Info from multiple sources, hard to analyze
        - Difficult to be a skilled interviewer
        - May intimidate the interviewee

    5 Steps of an interview:
        Preparing for the interview
        Planning and scheduling the interview
        Opening and closing the interview
        Conducting the interview
        Following up for clairification

    Types of interviews:
        Structured
        Unstructured (let's explore the situation)

    Try to avoid using the words: problems, better
